Description

This is a simple console-based To-Do List program in Python. Users can manage their tasks by:

Viewing all tasks

Adding new tasks

Removing tasks by selecting their number

The program uses input validation to prevent errors and displays tasks in a clear, numbered list for easy management.

Future Enhancements

Some ideas to make this project more advanced:

Save tasks to a file so they persist between program runs

Mark tasks as completed instead of removing them

Sort tasks by priority or due date

Add a GUI using Tkinter for a more visual interface

Add search or filter functionality for easier task management
