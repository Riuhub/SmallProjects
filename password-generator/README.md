Description

This is a simple Python program that generates random passwords. Users can customize their password by specifying:

Length (between 12 and 20 characters)

Whether to include letters

Whether to include numbers

Whether to include symbols

The program ensures user input is validated and prevents errors, producing a secure, randomly generated password each time.

Future Enhancements

Some improvements to make this project even better could include:

Enforce at least one character from each selected type (letters, numbers, symbols) to increase security

Save generated passwords to a file for later use

Add a GUI using Tkinter for a more user-friendly experience

Allow the user to generate multiple passwords at once
